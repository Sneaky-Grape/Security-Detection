# Security-Detection

Hello! This project is a program which uses Artificial Intelligence to detect different types of objects and classifies if they are either dangerous or safe!

Overview
In many public places, safety is a priority. With this program, anyone can survey the surrounding area to find if anyone is wielding anything dangerous. This can come in use for events such as concerts, protests, and fundraisers. There is a lot of people to account for, and the safest 
Going to the supermarket/shopping may sometimes be a hassle when paying the cashier with physical money, expecially when you are using coins. Don't worry! With the Coin Counter, all the problems of a lengthened check out time could be cut down to just a few seconds.

How it Works
After running the program in the jetson nano, the camera is opened and uses the detection from detectnet to identify what each type of coin is. It would then add up each of the coins, respective to the amount it is worth. The program then adds up all the coins to get a final sum of how much money is in the coin pile.

Materials
All you need is a webcam and a jetson nano kit, consisting of a power supply, HDMI cable, wifi dongle, mouse, and keyboard. Don't forget, you also might need coins, so that the program can detect them!
